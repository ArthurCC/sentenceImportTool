# sentenceImportTool
This addon is compatible with Anki 2.1 and is intended to work with the addon Japanese Support (https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3918629684)

Allows the user to import multiple sentences from a txt file and create notes relative to those sentences. The note type of the deck which will contain the created cards must be "Japanese (recognition)" from the addon Japanese Support

The format of the imported file must be as follows :  
[sentence]  
[word];[definition]  
  
see the file [sentences_example.txt]https://github.com/ArthurCC/sentenceImportTool/blob/master/sentences_example.txt
This addon uses the Japanese Recognition support to get the reading of a sentence with furigana
